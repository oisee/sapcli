## Translation Notes

### No Translation Required

All source documents were originally written in English by Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5) as part of the ADT repository ecosystem analysis. No actual translation was performed - files were simply copied to the `en/` directory for organizational purposes.

### Content Characteristics

The reports maintain:
- Professional technical language
- Consistent terminology across all documents
- Technical terms (ADT, TypeScript, Python, ABAP, MCP, etc.) as-is
- Numerical scores, percentages, and ratings unchanged
- Markdown formatting preserved exactly
- Tables, code blocks, and file paths unchanged
- All links and references intact

### Document Structure

Each individual report follows this structure:
1. Overview (purpose, language, dependencies, documentation)
2. ADT API Coverage Assessment (0-10 scoring per category)
3. Architecture Analysis (code organization, extensibility, type safety, testing)
4. Integration Assessment (SAP connectivity, session handling)
5. Maturity Score (0-100 total with breakdown)
6. Strengths and Weaknesses
7. Use Cases (primary uses, integrations, best/not suitable for)
8. Recommendations (for adoption and improvement)

### Key Findings Summary
